## Welcome to loopback-oss-helper!

yeah its loopback, means communicate with the computer itself. (specifically localhost:37373 (default))

is a program designed to be used on streams.
and this program is a little bit (or a lot) complicated for normal streamers because this requires you know a little bit about the command line.

and this isn't really a helper nor a bot. this is a widget for streaming that is based on npm/node.js and tampermonkey ofc.

this project, i made it with AI, specifically ChatJippity..ahem..ahem...ChatGPT.
